# DEPNotify-PUB
 Public DEPNotify REPO

This code was updated and adjusted for our EDU environment.
Included in the DEPNotify scripts are some basic logic to leverage the "ROLE" to deploy a specific set of app Policies.
I am using the roles of "Faculty, Staff, and Students" to flow into the JAMF Department field and Building to relate to campus (Primary, Middle and Upper School)

I have also been using Installomator 8.0 as part of the policies being called to assure latest deployment of key applications.
